- things that are attracted to magnets /are/ magnets (temporarily become "magnets" when in field)
- like charges increase strength of field
- unlike charges cancel out field
- any "piece" of a magnet is full magnet (any "magnet" is "infinite" small magnets, end to end (not really but you get the idea))
- magnetism is /fundamental/
- field is simply distance function (charge/d2)
- field cannot specify direction (implies known effected charge)
- difference between force/transfer of energy (I actually don't know answer)
- build up from unpaired electrons -> magnet
