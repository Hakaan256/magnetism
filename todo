- dirt background
- background for "guess" sidebar (only have the "tools" bg asset that's segmented into 3 groups
- (could bake "COMPASSES","IRON FILINGS",etc... titles into background for both if you want exact control of how it will look)

- are we doing the black teardrops for pole-guesses? or the dotted line? or the faded out magnet?
- if teardrop:
- - magnet-guess-placer specifically for the "N" pole and the "S" pole individually
- - I could gen the black teardrop icon w/ shadow, or you could give me that asset
- if dotted:
- - should I gen this? what specifies N/S?

- what happens when you guess? girl pops up and gives debrief/try again? <- this is the assumption I'm working from until otherwise instructed

- what does playground look like? is it any different? (I don't think its on the table to throw out playground- very important to build intuition by seeing realtime updates to field)
